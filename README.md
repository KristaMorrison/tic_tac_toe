# tic_tac_toe
Tic Tac Toe game

This was a three-day project to demonstrate skills in jQuery, completed as part of my education at LEARN Academy. It was a pair programming project with Amir Nazemian and Jon Richardson.

The challenge was to create a functional tic-tac-toe game, where the users could play against each other, and the game would keep track of each user's wins.

We chose to go with a pirate theme for our game, and carried that throughout.  Be sure not to miss the Kraken gif which shows up with a stalemate, as well as the spinning dubloons added with each win!
